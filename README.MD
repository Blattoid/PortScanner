# PortScanner

I got bored one day and thought "Hey I could make a portscanner!". So, I did.

## Okay, so how do you use it?

You can either call it from a command line (as it takes parameters), or by running the executable normally. 
If you choose to run it from the command line, the syntax is `portscanner.exe <address> [startport:endport]`. A port range isn't necessary, but it is recommended as a full scan can take about 18 hours.
Should you choose to execute the program directly, it will ask for the details to be entered before the scan. In this mode, it will pause at the end to allow you to read everything instead of abruptly closing.
